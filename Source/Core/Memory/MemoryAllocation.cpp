// "Small" allocations
// 16 bytes - 32kb allocations fit in here
// Cached size -> index into table conversion
// Small allocations probably will take up the most allocations (not the most memory)
//
// Large allocations coming directly from the OS
// There will be some kind of caching solution that keeps a specific amount of memory
// around from these large allocations
//
// Blocks of memory need to have some sort of header to them, but without actually having
// the memory contain the header. Block info would describe the actual size of the block,
// be associated with a block of allocated memory, and live in some other structure that 
// uses the ptr address as a unique id to access this info. If I use a page (64Kb) to 
//
// So how to split up the address (unique id) so that they fall into a set amount of elements of block info?
// By shifting address over 16 (2 ^ 16 is 65536 or page size), we get rid of the 0s that are there because of alignment
// and get a more workable number. The bits at the bottom of the address vary a fair amount between allocations vs the upper bits,
// so this could be the table elements within the hash table
//
// This algorithm uses the important parts of the address, as well as the entire memory address spectrum
// This is currently on my system, which has 16Gb memory (really a little less, but it uses 16Gb exactly)
// Max buckets for this amount of memory is 128 and max pools per 64k is 2048 (pool is 32 bytes).
// You get these numbers by using the total amount of 64Kb allocations a system can essentially have
//
// My system (16Gb) can have have 262,144 allocations of 64kb (17,179,849,184 / 65536).
// If I were to allocate 64Kb per hash table element, I could fit 2048 32 byte headers within that memory.
// Because of this, if I divide total possible page allocations by number of headers per element (262,144 / 2048)
// I get the amount of table elements that are needed, which is 128
//
// CURRENTLY, THE THEORY BELOW DOESN'T WORK... NEED TO THINK ABOUT THIS MORE. USING 1MB COULD OFFER BETTER RESULTS DOWN THE ROAD...
// MIGHT BE ABLE TO MAP THE INDEX RECEIVED BY THE PTR TO SOME OTHER STRUCTURE THAT DOESN'T TAKE UP A WHOLE MEGABYTE TO MAKE THIS WORK...
// If I were to up my size and allocate 1Mb (1,048,576), I would be able to do that 16,384 times
// Keeping my page allocation, and the header count of 2048, I would do 16,384 / 2048, which results in 8 table elements
//
// For not power of 2 memory spaces, needs to essentially go to the nearest bit bit above the total memory space

// TODO - Research Virtual memory and understand how it works and how to map a lot of virtual memory space to 
// physical memory and make it worth while

// TODO - Look into using a Best-Fit RedBlack tree to store medium allocations (Hacky talked about this idea in GDC talk)
// Might not be needed, but it might be good to look at stats of allocations
