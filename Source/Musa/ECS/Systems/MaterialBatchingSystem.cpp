// RenderComponent contains mesh and material data. This data needs to be pushed to the
// actual rendering system path. Currently, I can't do this, so I need to add some code
// in the render pipeline to actually accept the data from this ECS system...

// Steps that currently happen in the deferred render pipeline:
//	1) After update, push updated data to the corresponding RenderObject 
//	   within the RenderObjectManager. See RenderObjectManager::SequenciallyPull
//	2) Render starts
//	3) Gets the RenderContext, "screen" view, and the RenderObjectManager. These are used within
//	   the main render of the scene objects. The RenderObjectManager isn't used outside of rendering
//	   the scene
//	4) The context marks the beginning of the frame, which sets up the frame for rendering. It takes in
//	   the scene's viewport
//	5) The main render pass starts now. This goes and renders the scene to the GBuffer, then uses it to 
//	   render lighting to the scene color buffer
//	6) After the scene is rendered to the color buffer, the UI gets processed. Currently, this isn't a real
//	   implementation of UI in general, so this will hopefully change along with ECS being integrated within
//	   the rendering. The spirit will stay the same, which is rendering the UI to a single color texture that
//	   only gets rendered to when the UI changes.
//	7) Next is the composition of the back buffer. Both the UI color buffer and the scene color buffer are 
//	   rendered onto the back buffer in preperation for presentation
//	8) The context now marks the end of the frame, which means the frame attempts to present itself to the window

// Looking at the non-ECS way of doing things right now, what these rendering systems seek to do is to replace
// the RenderObjectManager::SequentiallyPull function and RenderObjects in general, add culling to the render,
// and clean up relationship between rendering and updating. The last part involves giving render items to the
// main render with all of the information that they would need, without touching the mesh or material (CPU data...)

// To execute this, currently, there would be 2 systems involved: Culling and Rendering. The CullingSystem would be 
// the first to update and it essentially removes the entities from consideration for the RenderingSystem. It does this
// by adding a "Culled" empty component

// We have access to all of the chunks here. We should transform the data within each component into 
// data that can be submitted to the render pipeline

// Either we submit each component to the render pipeline or submit packets of render data to the render pipeline to use
// If the former is developed, it will keep this system very simple. If the latter is developed, this system handles 
// most of the complexity of the render when it comes to sorting and batching. This is the ideal situation definitely

// It makes sense to keep mesh data and material data coupled, in a way, because a mesh, to be drawn, needs a material.
// This will prevent a bunch of context switching and keep things relatively fast. The likelihood of the same material
// being used by multiple objects, at least in 3D, is minimal I'd say. If there are multiple instances of a mesh and
// material, that just would use GPU instancing down the line anyways

// Need to sort transparency vs opaque, which essentially depends on the material itself. If the material allows for 
// transparency, then it goes in that bucket of RenderComponents, which eventually gets sorted back to front. The 
// opaque geometry would then get sorted by material, or more accurately, its properties, so as to not switch context 
// for each kind of material
